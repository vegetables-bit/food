      <img src="assets/Nsima Beef 2.jpg" alt="Nsima with Beef">
      <div class="text-align">
      <h1>Nsima with Beef, well prepared and cooked dish</h1>
        <p>Nsima is a traditional Malawian staple made from finely ground maize flour. It is usually served hot and forms the base of most meals in Malawian households. In this dish, it is perfectly complemented with tender pieces of beef cooked in rich, spicy tomato gravy.</p>
        <p>The beef is simmered slowly to ensure it‚Äôs soft, juicy, and infused with the flavors of fresh garlic, onions, and locally sourced spices. Served with fresh green vegetables on the side, it offers a balance of taste and nutrition.</p>
        <p>This meal not only satisfies hunger but also gives you a real taste of home. It‚Äôs a go-to for both lunch and dinner, filling you with comfort and flavor. A plate of Nsima and beef speaks of warmth, tradition, and pride in Malawian cuisine.</p>

      <div class="text-align">
      <h1>Feel our nice prepared and cooked Kondowole with Chicken</h1>
        <p>Kondowole is a sticky, elastic dish made from cassava flour and water, stirred until thick. It is very common in the northern region of Malawi and known for its heavy, satisfying feel. When paired with well-seasoned chicken, it becomes a powerful and delicious meal.</p>
        <p>The chicken is marinated and cooked in traditional spices, giving it a deep flavor that complements the neutral tone of kondowole. This combination creates a unique contrast in both texture and taste.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs a dish loved during special family gatherings or when you just need something traditional and fulfilling. Eating kondowole with your fingers, as customary, adds a cultural touch and makes the experience even more authentic.</p>
      </div>
        <img src="assets/Kondowole Usipa.jpg" alt="Kondowole with Usipa">
        <div class="text-align">
      <h1>Well prepared and cooked Kondowole with Usipa</h1>
      <p>This version of kondowole is served with Usipa, small fish that are popular in Malawi, especially around Lake Malawi. These tiny fish are usually deep-fried or boiled in tomato sauce and served with spicy relish.</p>
      <p>The crispiness of the fish offers a nice bite, while the kondowole balances the bold taste with its smooth texture. Together, they make an iconic dish that brings memories of the lakeside and home-cooked meals.</p>
      <p>This is not just a meal; it‚Äôs part of our heritage. Whether you‚Äôre from the lakeshore or just love fish, kondowole with Usipa is an unforgettable experience that tastes like home.</p>

      <h1>With your family you can enjoy our dishes even at your home</h1>
      <p>Rice is a widely loved dish across Africa, and in this offering, it's served with well-cooked beans in a rich tomato gravy. It‚Äôs a perfect vegetarian option that‚Äôs both healthy and hearty.</p>
      <p>The beans are slow-cooked until soft and seasoned with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and spices to create a thick, flavorful stew. The rice is fluffy and absorbs the gravy well, making every bite satisfying.</p>
      <p>This dish is especially ideal for a quick, filling lunch or dinner. It‚Äôs affordable, nutritious, and suitable for all age groups. Whether you eat it alone or with a side of salad, it never disappoints.</p>
      </div>
      <img src="assets/Rice Pork.jpg" alt="Rice with Pork">
      <div class="text-align">
      <h1>For those who like Pork, here's your first choice</h1>
      <p>This colorful rice dish is filled with vegetables, beef or chicken, and cooked in seasoned tomato sauce. Common in West Africa but loved in Malawi too, this fried rice is perfect for parties and celebrations.</p>
      <p>It‚Äôs aromatic, spicy, and visually appealing. Every spoonful offers a burst of flavor; from peppers and onions to sweet carrots and savory meat. A drizzle of soy sauce or tomato paste boosts the flavor even more.</p>
      <p>This dish is great for guests or takeaways. Whether you're packing a lunchbox or serving dinner at home, Jollof or fried rice is a guaranteed hit.</p>
